This essay examines Thomas Jefferson's relationship with colonized people. It argues that Jefferson both reflected the chauvinism through which social relations were ideologically expressed, and that he was important in shaping the US into an imperialist power.

*Jeffersonian Oppression and Founding Imperialism* offers a critical perspective on the newly-born United States and its third President. This essay tackles the relationship between Thomas Jefferson’s views on colonized people and the structural qualities of the nascent United States while also delving into Marxist historical method and historiographic critique. This essay compliments much of the historical analysis presented at Anti-Imperialism.com and in title’s such as J. Sakai’s Settlers, the Mythology of the White Proletariat.
