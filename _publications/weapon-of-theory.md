An 'advanced introduction' to Maoist (Third Worldist) theory and practice. Quote from the introduction:

> Monopoly capitalists in imperialist states glean most of their profits from exploitation of Third World labor, and they make such a killing on Third World exploitation that they can afford to pay their “own” workers in the First World a value well above what those workers themselves produce, while still maintaining average profit rates. In other words, high wages in the First World are supplemented with profit extracted from Third World workers. This means that class struggle has been largely deadened in the First World, because most workers in the imperialist core depend upon imperialism to sustain their current living standards. The contradiction between the working class in the imperialist nations and the bourgeoisie has become a non-antagonistic one. What this means for communist praxis in the First World is still somewhat of an open question.
