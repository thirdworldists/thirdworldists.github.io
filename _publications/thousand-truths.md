5. Does Marxism oppose democracy?
6. Does communism oppose individuality?
7. Socialism? That means more state regulations, wage hikes, and welfare programs?
8. What is capitalism?
9. Doesn't Capitalism reward hard work?
10. Can’t we just get capitalism to work for everybody?
11. If capitalism is so bad, why do we have it?
12. How can you say Americans are not exploited!? Millions of Americans live in abject poverty!
