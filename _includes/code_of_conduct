Code of conduct
---------------

**All RAIM members must strive to advance revolution and the cause of the proletariat to the best of their ability.** This is the most basic and fundamental requirement. Other requirements, in service to the main requirement, are as follows:

RAIM members must:

1. Work to unite all who can be united around the cause of revolution while isolating the enemy: capitalism-imperialism and its embodied ruling class
2. Strive to unite revolutionary forces nationally and internationally (without falling into opportunism)
3. Obey orders from the relevant leadership (whether this be the leadership of the local RAIM cell or the leadership of RAIM itself)
4. Create and maintain a safe organisation, maintaining no tolerance for internal violence or chauvinism

RAIM members must not:

1. Exploit or antagonize any RAIM member, or harm RAIM or any RAIM member in any way
2. Display chauvinistic attitudes, or in any other manner cause harm to the well-being of the revolutionary movement and its potential to inspire the masses toward revolutionary organising and action

Although it is impossible to escape antagonism entirely within the context of the capitalist system, for organizational purposes we understand antagonistic, exploitative, or harmful behavior as that which exacerbates contradictions, rather than mitigating them. We understand our code of conduct as having been violated to the extent that antagonistic, exploitative, or harmful behavior significantly disrupts political activity, for example: through alienating members or eroding trust in the organization.

Additionally, since we do not possess any real or reliable means of reforming or remolding violent chauvinists, members who pose a direct and persistent threat to other RAIM members or the masses in general MUST face immediate expulsion without exception.

RAIM members should:

1. Strive to advance their political understanding in service to revolution
2. Strive to advance their own skills and capabilities in service to revolution
3. Strive to advance the position of RAIM in service to revolution
4. Conduct themselves in a manner worthy of emulation and respect by revolutionary forces and the masses
5. Maintain unity in the presentation of RAIM's political line
6. Challenge manifestations of liberalism within and without the revolutionary movement

RAIM members should not:

<ol>
	<li>Use criticism and self-criticism in a manner that:
		<ol type="A">
			<li>Divides, not unites RAIM and the revolutionary movement;</li>
			<li>Hides, not identifies, their own shortcomings;</li>
			<li>Is on a personal, not political, level</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Display arrogance, negativism, individualism, or adventurism</li>
	<li>Lend credibility to chauvinism through either words or deeds via engaging in uncritical political organising with its proponents</li>
</ol>

RAIM members are not superhuman, and are subject to the same class society socialisation everyone else is. Errors are inevitable, no matter how revolutionary the person. When errors occur, RAIM members should make criticism or respond to criticism in a comradely manner. We're all here to learn from each other, and treating ourselves as the enemy is counterproductive.

Accountability
--------------

Should the code of conduct be violated, the issue will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

Due to the lack of independent institutions, we are limited in the types of disciplinary actions we can undertake. One of the things that is available to us is self-criticism. A rough outline for effective self-criticism is as follows:

<ol>
	<li>The offending party should be notified of the existence of the problem, without being told why it is a problem</li>
	<li>The offending party should try to understand the "why"s and "how"s of the problem by themselves</li>
	<li>The offending party should write the self-criticism, explaining:
		<ol type="A">
			<li>Why what they did was wrong,</li>
			<li>What steps they will take to avoid it in the future, and</li>
			<li>In consultation with the wronged party, what steps can be taken to right the wrong (if applicable)</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The leadership should then offer their own criticism of the offender/offense for a greater perspective on the nature of the mistake/offense</li>
</ol>

Self-criticism, on its own, should not be treated as full or proper reform, only as the first step towards that. Ultimately, the only valid type of reform is a reform of actions, not words.
