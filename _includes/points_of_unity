**1) Revolutionary Anti-Capitalism**

It is the objective of any revolutionary anti-capitalist organization to make revolution, for genuine unity to be had with any organization, it must first be understood that revolution against capitalism is our ultimate goal.

**2) Anti-Colonialism**

We unconditionally support the struggles of oppressed nations against imperialism and for their full right to self determination. This means that we work, firmly, to unite with all genuine movements against imperialism, colonialism (both semi- and neo-colonialism) worldwide, all must succeed before true world liberation can be had. We cannot unite with those struggles in the settler colonies who do not submit to the demands of their indigenous and occupied peoples!

**3) Anti-Amerikanism/Anti-Westernism**

The principal enemies of our movements are those imperialist blocs to which our countries belong or are subjected to. In the 21st century, all western peoples' first and foremost enemy is that of u.$. and european domination in the form of NATO and other imperialist organizations. This necessitates a program of principled revolutionary defeatism with regards to inter-imperialist rivalries involving our imperialist blocs and countries in particular (along with their proxy armies), and a maintained opposition to their political, economic, and cultural world-hegemony; all of our time, energy and resources must be put towards the defeat of western imperialism. With this in mind, it is clear that a defeat for western imperialism is a victory for the world proletarian movement trapped under its rule.

**4) Revolutionary Feminism**

We will not compromise our support for the gender/sexually oppressed people who suffer under the weight of patriarchal society. We cannot find unity with those who assist in or even deny the oppression of women and queer people, and who reject the existence of transgender people and their struggle. No common cause can be found with patriarchal oppressors.

**5) Anti-Opportunism**

We cannot unite with those who stand alongside the oppressors and the exploiters in the ranks of the military or the security forces (i.e. the pigs). Our struggle is against, not with, those who enforce the rule of the colonial and imperial states on the oppressed people of the world, and we make no exceptions. Unity with us means opposition to the oppressors and exploiters, nothing less.
