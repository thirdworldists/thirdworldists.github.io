**1) Revolution is the only way forward.**

The entire history of class society has built a monumental network of oppression that cannot be eliminated without a revolution that overturns all organs of class power, puts them in the hands of the oppressed, and finally abolishes them along with the class they serve. Capitalism cannot, and will not, abolish itself; only revolution can abolish class society and, through the implementation of socialism, achieve a classless one.

**2) Our struggle is against all systems of oppression.**

The root cause of all forms of oppression found in the world today is capitalism. So our struggle against capitalism is necessarily one against all systems of oppression. We aim to attack and dismantle all forms of systemic oppression. Patriarchy (and its attendant heterosexism and transmisogyny), white supremacy, systemic disableism, and colonialism; even the vast system of oppression of animals by human society. Without a struggle that fights to destroy these systems of oppression for **all** oppressed peoples and beings, not only are arbitrarily selective in our struggle to end oppression, but we can never hope to defeat class society or capitalism.

**3) We reject the legitimacy of settler-colonial nations.**

We do not recognize the legitimacy of nations such as the united states, israel, australia, south afrika or kanada. These nations and their structures are the product of colonial projects which have abused, displaced, and murdered the Indigenous peoples for the benefit of the occupiers. These nations and their occupying populations have done more than any others to aid imperialism, especially in the modern era. They owe their entire existence to a parasitic relationship with the oppressed nations and the Indigenous peoples they dominate. Without the self-determination of captive nations, and the decolonization of the whole country, there can be no successful socialist revolution.

**4) We reject the legitimacy of imperialist intervention.**

Imperialist intervention is never legitimate, regardless of context or method. The imperialist states will use all tools at their disposal to dominate the oppressed nations, from foreign aid to armed occupation. We will always resist attempts by the imperialist core to exert itself over the oppressed Third World peoples, including their own internal colonies.

**5) We reject all forms of opportunism.**

We stand in opposition to all forms of opportunism (the short-sighted prioritizing of short-term reformist gains, which on a systemic level leads to liquidation of the revolutionary movement). We strive to create a movement which aims at the dismantlement of the capitalist system, not capitulation to it or cooperation with it. Therefore we will not tolerate any attempts at class collaboration, "toning down" our politics, or the renunciation of these points of unity. 

**6) We reject all forms of chauvinism**

We stand in opposition to all forms of chauvinism. We believe firmly that one's actions reflect their politics. We have absolutely no tolerance for misogyny (and its attendant heterosexism and transmisogyny), white supremacy, and disableism. We aim to be an organization which not only fights for oppressed people, but one which is safe for all oppressed people. If we cannot ensure that our organization is not an oppressive environment itself, we will be totally unable to fight the oppression of society at large. Chauvinism is to be combated individually by every one of us, and collectively, by our solidarity with the oppressed and our intolerance for all those who reproduce their oppression. 

**7) RAIM is a Third-Worldist organization.**

Third-Worldism is essentially the analysis that the First World has economically, socially, and politically subordinated the Third World. We understand that we must “break up the colonial world” to liberate the Third World from the imperialist domination of the First. This is articulated through things like national liberation, collective self-reliance and cooperation between Third World nations, partisanship in solidarity with the Third World within the First World, and ultimately a kind of alter-globalization from a communist perspective, rather than the current capitalist form of globalization. We are of the opinion that if communism is the organization of the proletariat and its allies to abolish the bourgeoisie, and feminism is the organization of non-men and their allies to abolish “man” as a social stratum, then Third-Worldism is the organization of the Third World and its allies to abolish the First. Our role in this strategy is to share equally in the burden of making revolution and assisting in the liberation of both oppressed Third World nations and internal colonies trapped within the imperialist core; our goal is the decolonization of the colonial world, and the abolition of the First World.
