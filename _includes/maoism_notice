RAIM has since moved away from calling itself "Maoist (Third Worldist)", now prefering "Third Worldist Marxist", or simply "Third Worldist". We see Third Worldism (and Marxism as a whole) as far more important than any particular national Marxist ideology someone might subscribe to, so for anti-sectarian reasons, RAIM is no longer an explicitly Maoist (Third Worldist) organisation, but a Marxist and Third Worldist one with Maoists, Leninists, and others, in it.
