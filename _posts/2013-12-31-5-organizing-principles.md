### Dedication

Revolutions do not come easily. Rather, they require a variety of factors,
including a determined force of collective vanguard elements composed of quality cadre.

### Education

To be a revolutionary is to be both a learner and teacher. Cadres must
dedicate themselves to learning both from the previous experience of
revolutionary movements and from day-to-day practice.

### Outreach

It is not enough to know the world. Communists must change it. This begins
with building public opinion and organizing ever greater numbers into
revolutionary coalitions.

### Independence

In order to maintain tactical initiative and strategic strength, it is
necessary for vanguard elements to operate alongside and among various forces while retaining ultimate independence.

### Internationalism

All of our actions must be based on the emergent and long-standing needs of
global proletarian revolution. Communists must be a beacon of proletarian
politics while having strategic confidence in the ability of the exploited and oppressed masses to carry forward revolution.
