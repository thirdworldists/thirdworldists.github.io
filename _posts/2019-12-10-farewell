description: After 13 years of work, our organization has dissolved.

After nearly 13 years of existence, the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement (RAIM) is no more. Contradicting lines and practical inadequacies have been allowed to fester to the point of intractability, resulting in several splits and the widespread abandonment of our organization. The remaining members have made the decision that, considering the current lack of political unity, the organization be dissolved and all projects thereof be concluded. The precise future of our publications and initiatives will be decided by those who succeed the organization, but none will continue to carry the name of RAIM.

While our years of work have not been entirely meritless, we would not have met such a fate if our successes had outweighed the failures. Ultimately it was our failure to regularly, concisely and scientifically summarize our work through the process of criticism and self-criticism that proved most critical. The consequences this had on the consistency of our line, and therefore the two-line struggle, were far-reaching and ultimately fatal to our organization. Unfortunately this is not something that can be rectified here. The task of detailing the experiences and failures of our organization will be left to the individuals and groups that have succeeded RAIM. This message will be the last to carry the organization's name, there will be no updates to follow from here.

For those who supported and believed in our work, and for those whom it was intended to serve, we offer our sincerest apology for the failure of our leadership. There is no more room for excuses. The inadequacy of the model RAIM presented has been decisively proven in its dissolution. What is left to do must be done by better formations and stronger leadership.
