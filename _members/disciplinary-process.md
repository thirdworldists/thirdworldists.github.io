All RAIM members are expected to abide by the [RAIM code of conduct](/members/code-of-conduct/). The following procedure is to be carried out when a RAIM member is suspected of oppressive behavior:

1. A RAIM member (or OGC member in the case of suspected patriarchal behavior) or team of members shall be assigned to be a point of contact between RAIM (or the OGC) and the person under investigation. It is not the responsibility of the point of contact to do all the work in this framework, rather the point of contact is only the person who has to physically talk to the person under investigation.

2. The point of contact shall inform the person under investigation that RAIM is investigating claims of the person's oppressive behavior. Only the most general terms should be used (example: we are investigating claims of the person's patriarchal behavior).

3. The point of contact shall inform the person under investigation that the latter is SUSPENDED from all RAIM activity until otherwise informed. Meaning: a) The person under investigation shall not participate in any RAIM functions until otherwise informed; b) The person under investigation shall not make any claims in public on behalf of RAIM until otherwise informed.

4. The point of contact shall inform the person under investigation that the latter is NOT to make contact with ANY RAIM member except for the designated point of contact until otherwise informed.

5. The point of contact shall ask the person under investigation to prepare a statement regarding what (if anything) the person under investigation feels they have done wrong. When finished, this statement is to be given to the point of contact.

6. While the person under investigation is preparing their initial statement, RAIM (or the OGC in the case of suspected patriarchal behavior) will investigate the situation on its own.

7. When the person under investigation finishes their initial statement and delivers it to the point of contact, the point of contact shall discuss any discrepancies between the statement and RAIM's (or the OGC's) own findings with the person under investigation.

8. The person under investigation shall be given an opportunity to modify their initial statement and resubmit it to the point of contact.

9. On the basis of RAIM's (or the OGC's) own findings and the statement of the person under investigation, RAIM (or the OGC) will determine if the person under investigation shall be disciplined and what the terms of the discipline shall be (if applicable).

10. If the person under investigation is to be disciplined, the point of contact shall provide the person under investigation with a statement containing the terms of the discipline and a thorough explanation therein.

11. Once the terms of the discipline are completed, or if the person under investigation is not to be disciplined, the person shall be informed that they are free to resume RAIM activities, unless the person has been expelled. RAIM (or the OGC) may however place conditions on the resumption of RAIM activities at its discretion.

However, as the code of conduct states "since we do not possess any real or reliable means of reformation or remolding violent chauvinists, members who pose a direct threat to other RAIM members or oppressed people in general MUST face immediate expulsion without exception". Any violation of this rule bypasses the terms of the disciplinary process presented here, and the perpetrator will be immediately expelled.
