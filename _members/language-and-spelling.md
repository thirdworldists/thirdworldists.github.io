**Content Warning: This document contains uncensored slurs and oppressive language of every variety.**

These regulations on omitting and/or replacing certain terms and phrases must be enforced in all organisational media. Local RAIM cells are encouraged - either individually or in tandem with one another - to add to these based on an analysis of local/regional conditions, and enforce them as they see fit in their own media. They are not mandatory for individual RAIM cadre, though are strongly recommended (Chauvinistic language being the exception, particularly in cases where said language does not target the individual cadre). This resolution only covers English-language media, though this may change in the future.

## Omit

_All oppressive language must be removed from all organisational media. If for whatever reason an oppressive term or phrase has to be used, it must be censored (e.g. wh\*rephobia, w\*\*\*ephobia, w\*\*\*\*phobia). Commonly used oppressive terms are listed as examples below._

* Racist slurs; terms and phrases which reproduce national oppression (e.g. gypsy, gypped).

* Misogynistic slurs; terms and phrases which reproduce patriarchy, including those which target sex workers (e.g. prostitute).

* Cisheterosexist slurs; terms and phrases which reproduce heterosexism or cissexism, including those which target women and gender outlaws (e.g. bugger, butthurt, suck it).

* Disableist slurs; terms and phrases which reproduce disableism, including those which generally target neurodivergent people (e.g. crazy, derp, fool, insane, loony, lunatic, mad, maniac, mental, neurotic, nuts, psycho, weak/feeble-minded; wack) or otherwise reference intellectual capability (e.g. brainless, daft, dimwit, dipshit, dull, dumb, idiot,  imbecile, moron, simple, stupid, thick, unintelligent), as well as non-literal references to disabilities (e.g. blind, cripple, crutch, deaf, delusional, lame, myopic, OCD, psychotic, short-sighted), and terms that otherwise reproduce disableism (e.g. cretin, invalid, physically disabled, vegetative).
