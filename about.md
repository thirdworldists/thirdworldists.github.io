## What is RAIM?

{% include what_is_raim %}

## Points of Unity

RAIM unites sororally with all organizations and individuals who uphold these points:

**For further information, consult our [cardinal principles](/members/cardinal-principles/), our list of [RAIM publications](/publications/), or our media cells (listed below).**

## What do we do?

Practically, RAIM exists as a collection of cells. These cells can be divided into two categories: on-the-ground cells and media-based cells. On-the-ground cells are involved in building public opinion in support of Third Worldism through practical work and agitation, working toward building independent institutions of the oppressed which challenge the material and cultural hegemony of the bourgeoisie, and building coalitions with other like-minded groups and individuals with worked-out line differences. Media cells are, as the name implies, primarily involved in media projects.

RAIM cells are somewhat independent and are responsible for making decisions for themselves without needing to wait for orders from a central command. All RAIM cells are, however, united around RAIMâ€™s points of unity and Third Worldist line.

### Media Projects:

* [Anti-Imperialism.org](http://anti-imperialism.org/)
* [Revolutionary Ecology](http://revolutionaryecology.com/)
* [Siglo De Lucha](http://siglodelucha.wordpress.com/)
* [Dare to Win](/publications/dare-to-win/)

## Get involved!

There are a million reasons to oppose capitalism-imperialism but only one solution: revolution. But revolutions do not just happen spontaneously. They require the dedicated efforts of an advanced element representing the proletariat. RAIM exists to push forward the subjective forces of socialism and communism. Yet what we are doing so far is only the beginning. And we need your help.

Through our various on-the-ground and media cells, RAIM provides a number of ways for people to get involved. We strongly encourage those who find agreement with our points of unity and are looking to do something to [contact us](/contact/).
